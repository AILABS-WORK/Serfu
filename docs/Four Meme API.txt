Track All Four Meme Tokens That Have Migrated to Pancakeswap
This query tracks four meme token migrations to Pancakeswap in realtime by monitoring transactions sent to the Four Meme factory address (0x5c952063c7fc8610ffdb798152d69f0b9550762b) and filtering for PairCreated and PoolCreated events. These events are emitted when a token graduates from Four Meme and migrates to Pancakeswap. Test it here.

Bonding Curve Progress API for FourMeme token
Below query will give you amount of left tokens put it in the below given simplied formulae and you will get Bonding Curve progress for the token.

Bonding Curve Progress Formula
Formula: BondingCurveProgress = 100 - ((leftTokens * 100) / initialRealTokenReserves)
Where:

leftTokens = realTokenReserves - reservedTokens

initialRealTokenReserves = totalSupply - reservedTokens

Definitions:

initialRealTokenReserves = totalSupply - reservedTokens
totalSupply: 1,000,000,000 (Four meme Token)
reservedTokens: 200,000,000
Therefore, initialRealTokenReserves: 800,000,000
leftTokens = realTokenReserves - reservedTokens
realTokenReserves: Token balance at the market address.
note
Simplified Formula: BondingCurveProgress = 100 - (((balance - 200000000) * 100) / 800000000)

Additional Notes
Balance Retrieval:
The balance is the four meme token balance at this Four Meme: Proxy address (0x5c952063c7fc8610FFDB798152D69F0B9550762b).
Use this query to fetch the balance: Query Link.

Get Four Meme Tokens which are above 95% Bonding Curve Progress
Using the above Bonding Curve formula, we can calculate the token balances for the Four Meme Proxy contract (0x5c952063c7fc8610FFDB798152D69F0B9550762b) corresponding to approximately 95% to 100% progress along the bonding curve, that comes out to be 200,000,000 to 240,000,000. The tokens in the response are arranged in the ascending order of Bonding Curve Percentage, i.e., 95% to 100%. You can run and test the saved query here.

Get Four.Meme Tokens created by a specific Dev
This API fetches Four.Meme tokens created by a specific dev on BSC by tracking token minting transfers signed by a particular dev. Dev Address here in example is 0x9c75588640605d46b42f2d64c5c2e993de251210. Use a date filter based on your needs — shorter time ranges mean faster execution and reduced query time.

Get Realtime Market Cap and Price of a Four Meme Token
To get the market cap of a token we need two things, the latest PriceInUSD and total supply of the token. Total Supply is 1,000,000,000 (1B) for four meme tokens so we just need to get price and multiply it with 1B. This query helps with getting the latest USD price of a token and hence its latest Marketcap.

Market Cap = Total Supply * PriceInUSD

Check if a Four.meme Token is Phishy
This elaborative API approach uses two queries to detect if a Four Meme token is potentially phishy by analyzing the relationship between token transfers and trades. This approach helps identify tokens where recipients received tokens without purchasing them, which is a common pattern in phishing or airdrop scams.

How It Works
The detection method works by:

First Query: Get the first transfers of a token to addresses - this provides the timestamp of when each address first received the token.

Second Query: Check if those addresses ever bought the token and when - pass the address list from the first query as a variable to check their purchase history.

Analysis: Compare transfer times and trade times in your code:

If an address never bought the token, it's suspicious.

If an address's first buy time is later than the first transfer time, it indicates the token was received before being purchased, which is a red flag for phishing behavior.

Above analysis means someone else transferred the token to them which is phishy because devs often send token to famous KOLs or Influential People in crypto space to misguide traders.

We are taking here example of 0x35a7bb282d8caafe71617c9d52ee30f1adfe4444 token, this may or may not be phishy as we are not running the further comparison between timestamps. Here we are just demonstrating that how you can get data from Bitquery and later run basic analysis on it.

Query 1: Get First Transfers of a Token to Addresses
This query retrieves the first transfer of a token to each address, providing the timestamp when each address first received the token.

Run Query

Click to expand GraphQL query
Query 2: Get First Buys of an Address List for a Specific Token
This query checks if the addresses from Query 1 ever bought the token and when. Pass the address array from Query 1 as a variable to this query.

Run Query

Click to expand GraphQL query
Implementation Notes
Extract the address list and first transfer timestamps from Query 1
Pass the address array as a variable to Query 2
Compare the timestamps for all addresses:
If firstTransferTime < firstBuyTime or firstBuyTime is null → Phishy indicator
If firstBuyTime <= firstTransferTime → Normal behavior
You can implement this logic in your application code to automatically flag suspicious tokens
