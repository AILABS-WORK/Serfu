BSC Mempool Stream - Real-Time Transaction Monitoring
Monitor BSC (BNB Smart Chain) mempool transactions in real-time before they are confirmed on-chain. Track pending DEX trades, token creations, transfers, and detect opportunities early with Bitquery's Mempool APIs and Streams.

Any Bitquery GraphQL stream can be converted to a mempool monitoring stream by setting mempool: true.

We also provide low-latency Kafka streams to monitor broadcasted data, which are much faster than GraphQL mempool streams. Read more about Kafka streams here.

note
To query or stream data via GraphQL outside the Bitquery IDE, you need to generate an API access token.

How do we simulate txs for Bitquery Mempool APIs & Streams?
When a transaction is received by the node but not yet included in a block, Bitquery uses the following context to send mempool data:

The transaction is executed in the EVM (using the current pending block context).

The system captures the simulated receipt and trace.

For each batch of simulated transactions, Bitquery records the block header used as the execution context.

message BroadcastedTransactionsMessage {
  Chain Chain = 1;
  BlockHeader Header = 2;
  repeated Transaction Transactions = 3;
}
