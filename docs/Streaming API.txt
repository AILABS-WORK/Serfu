Track contract self-destruct events (Codes 12, 13, 14)
Monitor ephemeral MEV contracts
Track MEV builder payments
Security incident monitoring
Aggregate self-destruct statistics
Balance Change Reason Codes
The Transaction Balance Tracker API uses numeric codes to indicate why a balance changed. These codes are only available for native currency (ETH) transactions, not for fungible tokens or NFTs.

Code	Reason	Description
0	BalanceChangeUnspecified	Unspecified balance change reason
1	BalanceIncreaseRewardMineUncle	Reward for mining an uncle block
2	BalanceIncreaseRewardMineBlock	Reward for mining a block
3	BalanceIncreaseWithdrawal	ETH withdrawn from the beacon chain
4	BalanceIncreaseGenesisBalance	ETH allocated at the genesis block
5	BalanceIncreaseRewardTransactionFee	Transaction tip increasing block builder's balance
6	BalanceDecreaseGasBuy	ETH spent to purchase gas for transaction execution
7	BalanceIncreaseGasReturn	ETH returned for unused gas at the end of execution
8	BalanceIncreaseDaoContract	ETH sent to the DAO refund contract
9	BalanceDecreaseDaoAccount	ETH taken from a DAO account to be moved to the refund contract
10	BalanceChangeTransfer	ETH transferred via a call
11	BalanceChangeTouchAccount	Transfer of zero value to touch-create an account
12	BalanceIncreaseSelfdestruct	Balance added to the recipient as indicated by a self-destructing account
13	BalanceDecreaseSelfdestruct	Balance deducted from a contract due to self-destruct
14	BalanceDecreaseSelfdestructBurn	ETH sent to an already self-destructed account within the same transaction
15	BalanceChangeRevert	Balance reverted back to a previous value due to call failure
Field Availability by Currency Type
The availability of fields in the TokenBalance object depends on the type of currency being tracked:

Native Currency (ETH)
Available: BalanceChangeReasonCode, PreBalance, PostBalance, PostBalanceInUSD
Not Provided: TotalSupply, TokenOwnership
Fungible Tokens (ERC-20)
Available: PostBalance, PostBalanceInUSD, TotalSupply, TotalSupplyInUSD
Not Provided: PreBalance, BalanceChangeReasonCode, TokenOwnership
NFTs (ERC-721 / ERC-1155)
Available: PostBalance, TokenOwnership
Not Provided: PreBalance, BalanceChangeReasonCode, TotalSupply, TotalSupplyInUSD, PostBalanceInUSD
